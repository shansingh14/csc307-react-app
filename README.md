# CSC307 React App
Basic React App for CSC307 Course


# Running App
- This is the parent folder in which the React app directory is created. Since the ```create-react-app``` created a subfolder, the ```npm start``` script is only defined within the subfolder and won't run directly from this parent folder without modification to the package.json file.
- In order to fit the grading criteria for Part 2 of the assignment, the script to run the react app directly from top level folder was added to the package.json
